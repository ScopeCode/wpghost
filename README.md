#Wordpress Ghost editor

Inspired by [Ghost](http://tryghost.org/)

Even though it's not released right now, the markdown editor is inspiring.
Wordpress is a great CMS but its editor needs to be simplified.

Using [Dr. Markdown](https://github.com/icetan/dr-markdown) for instant results and [PHP Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/) for backend.

This project is simply for fun and to experiment with UI and Markdown language.
I do realize Ghost will have a Wordpress import feature but this might come in handy for those who just want the beautiful editor.

Please be aware that this is in experimental stages so blogger beware
