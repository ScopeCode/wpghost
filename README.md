#Wordpress Ghost editor

Inspired by [Ghost](http://tryghost.org/)

Even though it's not released right now, the markdown editor is inspiring.
Wordpress is a great CMS but its editor needs to be simplified.

Using [MarkdownJS](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) for instant results and WP-Markify for backend.

This project is simply for fun and to experiment with UI and Markdown language.
I do realize Ghost will have a Wordpress import feature but this might come in handy for those who just want the beautiful editor.

Please be aware that this is in experimental stages so blogger beware

Fork and contribute if you like &hearts; ily
